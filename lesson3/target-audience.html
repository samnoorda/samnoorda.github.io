        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience for 'The Temperature for Travelors' will be those who have reason
            to travel to various parts of World. Weather is an important part of planning
            excursions so that our patrons know what to wear and what to pack. I want this website
            to be a reliable place that people can go to plan their trips
        </p>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>
            Caleb is a 25-year-old male with no kids. He and his wife Kim are always looking
            for their next adventure. They enjoy the time that they get to spend traveling 
            together because they feel it brings them closer together. <br>
            Chris is a 37-year-old man who is in the auditing profession. His job requires
            him to travel to clients' locations all over the pacific northwest. Because he 
            is often at this location for weeks, he wants to make sure that he packs correctly.
        </p>
